# Definitions from the Reference (Database System Concepts, 7th Edition)

## **1. Transaction**
- **Definition:** A sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. A transaction ensures ACID properties to maintain database integrity.
---
## **2. ACID Properties**
- **Atomicity:** Ensures that all operations in a transaction are completed; if any part fails, the transaction is aborted.
- **Consistency:** Ensures that a transaction transforms the database from one valid state to another.
- **Isolation:** Ensures that transactions do not interfere with each other.
- **Durability:** Ensures that the effects of a committed transaction are permanent, even in case of a system failure.

---

## **3. Recovery Schema**
- A recovery schema outlines the methods and mechanisms for restoring a database to a consistent state after a failure. This includes transaction logs, checkpoints, and rollback/redo operations.

---

## **4. LOMA (Lock-Ordered Multi-Version Architecture)**
- A concurrency control mechanism ensuring that locks on objects follow a strict order to prevent deadlocks while supporting multi-versioning for isolation.

---

## **5. NOMA (Non-Ordered Multi-Version Architecture)**
- A concurrency control mechanism that allows operations to access any version of the data without strict locking order, improving concurrency.

---

## **6. NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access)**
- **Definition:** A computer memory architecture where memory access time depends on the memory's proximity to the processor.
- **Use Case:** Improves performance in **shared-memory architectures** by reducing memory access bottlenecks.
- **Example System:** Multi-core processors in high-performance computing environments.

---

## **7. Schedule**
- A sequence of operations from multiple transactions that specifies the order in which the operations are executed. Schedules are evaluated for serializability to ensure correctness.

---

## **8. Shared-Memory Architecture**
- **Definition:** An architecture where processors share the same memory and storage. Communication between processors is fast due to shared memory.
- **Advantages:** High-speed communication.
- **Disadvantages:** Limited scalability due to contention for shared resources.

---

## **9. Data Servers**
- **Definition:** Servers that store and manage data items, allowing clients to fetch and process data locally. Common in client-server architectures.
- **Example:** JSON, XML-based servers used for semi-structured data.

---

## **10. Transaction Servers**
- **Definition:** Servers designed to handle transactions. They process queries, execute transactions, and manage data consistency and concurrency.
- **Example:** SQL servers like Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server.

---

## **11. Blockchain**
- **Definition:** A decentralized, distributed ledger that records transactions in linked blocks secured by cryptography.
- **Properties:** Decentralization, tamper resistance, anonymity, irrefutability.
- **Applications:** Cryptocurrencies, supply chain, health care, and IoT.

---

## **12. Full Node (Blockchain)**
- **Definition:** A node that maintains a complete copy of the blockchain and participates in the consensus process.

---

## **13. Light Node (Blockchain)**
- **Definition:** A node that interacts with the blockchain by submitting transactions but does not maintain the full blockchain or participate in the consensus process.

---

## **14. Parallel System**
- **Definition:** A database system that uses multiple processors and disks to process data in parallel for improved throughput and response time.

---
## **15. Concurrency Control**
- **Definition:** Mechanisms that ensure transactions are executed concurrently without violating the consistency of the database.
- **Examples:** Locking protocols, timestamp ordering, and optimistic concurrency control.

---
## **16. RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access)**

**Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA)** is a high-performance communication protocol that allows one computer to directly access the memory of another computer without involving the operating system or the CPU on either side. It significantly reduces latency and increases throughput in data transfers by bypassing traditional network protocol stacks.

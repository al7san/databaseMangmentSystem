### Parallel Database Architectures

1. **Shared-Memory Architecture**  
   - **Description**: All processors share a common memory and disks.  
   - **Advantages**: Low communication overhead, easy to implement.  
   - **Disadvantages**: Limited scalability due to contention for shared memory.  
   - **Use Case**: Small-scale systems.  

2. **Shared-Disk Architecture**  
   - **Description**: Processors have private memory but share disk storage.  
   - **Advantages**: High fault tolerance, suitable for high data availability.  
   - **Disadvantages**: Disk bottlenecks, higher communication costs.  
   - **Use Case**: Medium-scale systems.  

3. **Shared-Nothing Architecture**  
   - **Description**: Each node has private memory and storage, communicating via a network.  
   - **Advantages**: High scalability, no resource contention.  
   - **Disadvantages**: High communication overhead, complex management.  
   - **Use Case**: Large-scale distributed systems.  

4. **Hierarchical Architecture**  
   - **Description**: Combines shared-memory, shared-disk, and shared-nothing approaches.  
   - **Advantages**: Flexible, balances scalability and performance.  
   - **Disadvantages**: Complex design and maintenance.  
   - **Use Case**: Large-scale hybrid systems.
